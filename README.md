# Building Microservices from Scratch	[Video]
This is the code repository for [Building Microservices from Scratch[Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-microservices-scratch-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
If you want to move away from the old method of application development to the new and dynamic microservices way, then this course is for you. Microservices is a way of breaking large software projects into loosely coupled modules that communicate with each other through simple APIs. 
In this course, you’ll walk through a step-by-step microservices approach that splits up the application into its functions via microservices and third-party plugins. You’ll see how microservices talk with each other via APIs and are all independent of each other irrespective of the language. These components will be built and tested to function as a standalone component. 
You’ll learn how microservices takes the core application and duplicates it into multiple running versions, using a load balancer bringing the performance of the app up to the service expectations.
By the end of the course, you’ll be able to develop, test, and monitor your applications with the microservices approach.
